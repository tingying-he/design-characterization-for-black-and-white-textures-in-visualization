# Experiment Code
Experiment Code for *Design Characterization for Black-and-White Textures in Visualization*  (DOI: [10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326941](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326941))

This folder contains the code for **Experiment 1** and **Experiment 3** from the paper *Design Characterization for Black-and-White Textures in Visualization*.

- `experiment1/`: Code for Experiment 1  
- `experiment3/`: Code for Experiment 3  
- `generate_stimuli_for_experiment3/`: Code used to generate stimuli for Experiment 3  

## Running the Experiments
To view Experiment 1 or Experiment 3, run the corresponding folder (`experiment1` or `experiment3`) on a PHP server.  
The original implementations of both experiments were developed with the [FROE framework](https://github.com/yvonnejansen/FROE).

## Replication on ReVISit
We replicated Experiment 1 using the ReVISit platform:  
- Study: [Pattern Design Study](https://revisit.dev/replication-studies/pattern-design-study/)  
- Code: [Replication Studies Repository](https://github.com/revisit-studies/replication-studies/tree/main)
