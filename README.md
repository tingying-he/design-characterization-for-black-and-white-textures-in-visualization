# Design Characterization for Black-and-White Textures in Visualization

This is a repository for all data and analysis scripts used in the paper "[Design Characterization for Black-and-White Textures in Visualization](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2023.3326941)", presented at [IEEE Visualization 2023](http://ieeevis.org/year/2023/welcome) and published in the journal [IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=2945). If you use the results in new projects or use it in a different way we would appreciate a citation:

## Folder Structure

- **`experiments-codes/`**  
  Contains the source code for running the studies (Experiment 1 and Experiment 3), including scripts for setting up the experiments and generating stimuli.  
  *Note:* Experiment 2 was a questionnaire distributed via LimeSurvey (Inria) and is therefore not included here.

- **`experiments-stimuli-results-analysis/`**  
  Contains the stimuli, collected results, and analysis scripts for Experiment 1, Experiment 2, and Experiment 3.

- **`graphics-replicability-stamp/`**  
  Contains the files submitted for the Graphics Replicability Stamp application.  
  Our Replicability Stamp record: [https://www.replicabilitystamp.org/#https-github-com-tingying-he-design-characterization-for-black-and-white-textures-in-visualization](https://www.replicabilitystamp.org/#https-github-com-tingying-he-design-characterization-for-black-and-white-textures-in-visualization)

- **`texture-design-interface/`**  
  An interactive interface for designers to test different texture designs on bar charts, pie charts, or maps by adjusting texture parameters. This tool was adapted for use in Experiment 1.


## Instructions for generating figures ([Graphics Replicability Stamp](https://www.replicabilitystamp.org/))
### Requirements

The R script contained within this repository requires, in addition to a normal R installation, several packages including (potentially more):

* `plyr`
* `dplyr`
* `tidyr`
* `reshape2`
* `ggplot2`
* `propCIs`

To install these required packages, run the following call from a command line: `Rscript -e "install.packages(c('plyr', 'dplyr', 'tidyr', 'reshape2', 'ggplot2', 'propCIs'), repos='https://cran.rstudio.com')"`

If you encounter problem with Pandoc:
1. To check whether Pandoc was correctly installed: ``Rscript -e "rmarkdown::pandoc_exec()"``
2. To install Pandoc from its official website: https://pandoc.org/installing.html . If you use macOS, you can also use Homebrew to install it: ``brew install pandoc``

### Running the R script

1. Clone this repository using `git clone git@github.com:tingying-he/design-characterization-for-black-and-white-textures-in-visualization.git` or download the code as a ZIP file from the repository.
2. Change to the cloned directory, and then navigate to the `graphics-replicability-stamp` folder by using the command `cd graphics-replicability-stamp`. All files related to the Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative are stored in this folder.
3. Once you are in the `graphics-replicability-stamp` directory, knit the `all-exp2-exp3-figures.Rmd` file by running `Rscript -e "library(rmarkdown); rmarkdown::render('./all-exp2-exp3-figures.Rmd', 'html_document')"`

### Files produced

After the script completes, in the `graphics-replicability-stamp/results` folder you should see the following figures from [the paper](https://tingying-he.github.io/assets/publications/papers/He_2024_Textures.pdf) in PDF format.

We are unable to script the other images in our paper, as they are design samples created by participants or old visualization examples.
